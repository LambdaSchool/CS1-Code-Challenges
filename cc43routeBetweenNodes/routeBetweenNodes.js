/* cc43 routeBetweenNodes https://repl.it/student/submissions/1510145
Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

Google "directed graph" and look under images for visual examples.
(Bonus: Write both DFS and BFS methods. You'll have to comment one

Here is a test graph: (please be sure to remove this dummy data before running tests)

 const graph = {
  a: {
    value: 'a',
    edges: []
  },
  b: {
    value: 'b',
    edges: []
  },
  c: {
    value: 'c',
    edges: []  },
  d: {
    value: 'd',
    edges: []
  },
  e: {
    value: 'e',
    edges: []
  },
};

graph.a.edges.push(graph.b, graph.d, graph.e);
graph.b.edges.push(graph.a, graph.e);
graph.d.edges.push(graph.e);
graph.e.edges.push(graph.c, graph.a);
console.log(routeBetweenNodes(graph.a, graph.c)); // true
console.log(routeBetweenNodes(graph.c, graph.a)); // false
*/

// Depth First Search

// Breadth First Search
function routeBetweenNodes(node1, node2) {
  const roadMap = {};
  const queue = [node1];

  const toPath = (node) => {
    if (roadMap[node.value]) return;
    roadMap[node.value] = true;
    node.edges.forEach(item => queue.push(item));
  };

  while (queue.length) {
    if (roadMap[node2.value]) return true;
    toPath(queue.shift());
  }
  return false;
}
