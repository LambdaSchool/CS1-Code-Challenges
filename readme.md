# CS1 - Lambda School Code Challenges
## Steps to ensuring your changes get pulled down:
1. **You will only need to run this step once:**
  - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ryanhca/CS1-Code-Challenges.git`
2. **To get the daily repo changes each day, run this:**
  - `git pull upstream master`

### You'll then have to resolve any merge conflicts that come up.
*(Don't worry, you'll be pros at this after you're done and this is something that you'll have to do in the real world... all the time)*
