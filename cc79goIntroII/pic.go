       Let's write a function that, given two integers, creates a two-dimensional array
       of uint8 values that represent an image. To do that, we need to allocate a two-dimensional
       array using `make`, with the length of the "outer" array given by the input y. Then, once
       we've allocated that 2D array, we need to allocate another array, each one of length x,
       for each slot in our outer array. Inside each of those inner arrays, store a uint8 given by
       some function of x and y. Some functions that produce interesting images include `(x + y) / 2`,
       `x * y`, and `x ^ y`, just to name a few examples. Your function should return the outermost array.
