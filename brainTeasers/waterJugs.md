You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Step 1: Fill the five-quart jug.
Step 2: Using the five-quart jug, fill the three-quart jug.  The five-quart jug will have two quarts remaining.
Step 3: Empty the three-quart jug, then pour the two quarts into the three-quart jug.
Step 4: Fill the five-quart jug, then fill the three quart jug using the five-quart jug, removing one quart from the five-quart jug.

Solution: The five-quart jug will have four quarts remaining.
