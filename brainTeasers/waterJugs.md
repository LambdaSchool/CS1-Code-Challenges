You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

You would fill the three quart jug with water. Then pour the 3qt jug in the 5qt. Then fill the 3qt jug again and pour enough out of the three qt jug to fill the 5 qt. Pour out the 5 qt jug. Then pour the remains of the three qt jug into the 5 qt. Then fill the 3qt jug and pour it into the 5 qt jug and there 4 qts."
