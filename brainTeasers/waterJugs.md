You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Take the full 5, use it to fill the 3-quart jug.  Empty the 3-quart jug, and place the remaining 2-quarts from the 5-quart jug into the small jug.  Refill the large jug.  Pour enough out of the large jug to fill the small jug.  This leaves 4 quarts in the larger jug.
