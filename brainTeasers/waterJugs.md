You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

1.  Fill up the five-quart jug and pour it into the three-quart jug, leaving two quarts left in the five-quart jug.
2.  Pour out the three-quart jug.
3.  Pour the two quarts from the five-quart jug into the three-quart jug, leaving two quarts in the three-quart jug and the five-quart jug empty.  
4.  Fill the the five-quart jug again.
5.  Pour the five-quart jug into the three-quart jug until the three-quart jug is filled.
6.  You now have four quarts of water in the five-quart jug.
