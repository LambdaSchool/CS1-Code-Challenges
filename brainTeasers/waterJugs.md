You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.


You would fill the five quart jug via the three quart jug, and then fill the three quart jug again and fill the last 2 quarts
of the five quart jug.  which would leave 1 quart in the 3 quart jug.  

You then empty the 5 quart jug, and fill it with the remaing quart in the 3 quart jug.  Fill the 3 quart jug again and pour
it into the 5 quart jug. 

This would give you exactly 4 quarts.
