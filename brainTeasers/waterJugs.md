You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

1. Fill the 5gb
2. Pour from 5gb into 3gb - remainder 2g in 5gb
3. Empty 3gb
4. pour the 2g in 5gb into 3gb
5. fill 5gb
6. pour 1g from 5gb into 3gb - remainder 4g in 5gb.
