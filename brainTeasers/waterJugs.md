You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

measure the 5, pour into the 3 to get 2 quarts remaining in the 5 quart. Do this twice.

Apparently you can't do that, as you dont have any other sort of containers.
So you pour 3 qt into the 5 twice. 5 qts in the 5 and 1 in the 3. Dump the 5, pour the 1 qt into the 5 container, and then pour 3 more into it to get the 4.
